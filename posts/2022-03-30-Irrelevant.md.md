description: "An irrelevant poem about philosophy"

The alarm clock rings, I've overslept
it's eight o'clock .. Oh damn!
Descartes, help me with this one, 
say more than just, "I am."

There's nothing in my closet that I want to wear.
Immanuel Kant help a bit and doesn't really care.

Now, what to eat for breakfast?
Oh Sigmund, help my mood.
I don't care about my past, the issue here is food. 

I check inside my pocket; l'm  poor as poor can be.
"Perspective!" Plato'd call it-he is no help to me.

I consider all my issues, then ponder all of you:
Your philosophic missions were not worth living through.

Questions that never asked and theories by the score; 
and then you wonder why think philosophy's a bore.
