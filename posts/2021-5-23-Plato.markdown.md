# Introduction
- In the entire history of political thought no thinker evoked the admiration, reverence and criticism that Plato did- Plato has left behind many important works out of which three the Republic, The Statesman and The Laws, were of perennial interest to all those interested in the history of political ideas.
- Plato has been generally regarded as the founder of philosophical idealism by virtues of his conviction that there is a universal idea in the world of eternal reality beyond the world of the senses.
- He was the first to formulate and define political ideas within a larger framework of a philosophical idea of Good. He was concerned about human life and human soul or human nature.
- He has been praised for his denunciation of materialism and brutish selfishness.
- Both Voltaire and Nietzche characterised Platonism as the intellectual side of Christianity.
- John Ruskin and William Morris were attracted by Plato's concern for human perfection and excellence. Plato, along with his disciple Aristotle has been credited for laying the foundations of Greek political theory on which the western political tradition rests. These two thinkers between themselves have explored, stated, analyzed and covered a wild range of philosophical perspectives and issues.


## Important turning points in Plato’s life
- the trial and execution of Socrates in 399 BC proved to be a turning point in Plato's life.
- As Taylor has beautifully commented the founding of Academy is a turning point in Plato's life and in some ways the most memorable event in the history of European science. It was a permanent institution for the pursuit of science by original research
- The Republic, the Statesman and the Laws were Plato's major works in political philosophy
## THEORY OF JUSTICE
- The concept of justice is the most important principle of Plato's political philosophy. The sub- title of the Republic, ‘Concerning Justice’ shows the extra ordinary importance which Plato attached to justice. Plato saw in justice the only practical remedy of saving his beloved Athens from decay and ruin.
- The main argument in the republi  is a sustained search after the location and nature of justice. He discovers and locates the principle of justice with the help of his ideal state.
- An ideal state for Plato possessed the four cardinal virtues of wisdom, courage, discipline and justice.
- It would have wisdom because its rulers were persons of knowledge, courage because its warriors were brave, self-discipline because of the harmony that pervaded the societal matrix due to a common agreement as to who ought to rule, and finally, justice of doing one's job for which one was naturally filled without interfering with others.
- For Plato, the state was ideal, of which justice was the reality. Justice was the principle on which the state had to be founded.
- According to Plato, justice does not consist in mer  adherence to the laws, for it is based on the inner nature of human spirit, it is also to the triumph of the stronger over the weaker, for it protects the weaker against the stronger.
- In a just state or society, the rulers and military, the producers all do what they ought to do. In such a society the rulers are wise, the soldiers are brave, and the producers exercise self- control or temperance.
- For Plato, justice is a moral concept. As Prof: Ernest Barker has rightly pointed out; justice for Plato is at once a part of human virtue and the bond which joins men together in the states. It makes man good and make him social"
- A similar view has been expressed by a Prof. Sabine when he wrote that for Plato' “Justice is a bound which holds the society together”.
## EDUCATION
- The main objective of Plato’s philosophy was to bring about reforms in the Greek city – states. The object of the Republic was to locate and thereafter establish justice in the ideal state and his scheme of education is the spiritual remedy for the realization of justice.
- According to Plato, social education is a means to social justice. It is; therefore, correct to say that education for Plato has been a solution to all the important questions during his period.
- The ideal state ruled by the philosopher king was made possible through an elaborate and rigorous scheme of education.
- Plato looked to education as an instrument of moral reform, for it would mould and transform human souls.
- Education inculcated the right values of selfless duty towards all, and was therefore positive. It helped in the performance of one's functions in society and in attaining fulfillment. Thus, education was the key to the realisation of the new social order.
- As Prof.: Ernest Barker has rightly pointed out; Plato’s scheme of education brings the soul into that environment which in each stage of its growth is best suited for its development.
- Following his teacher Socrates, Plato had a belief in the dictum that virtue is knowledge and for making people virtuous, he made education a very powerful instrument. Plato believed that education builds man’s character and it is therefore a necessary condition for extracting man's natural faculties in order to develop his personalities.
- According to Plato, education promotes justice and enables a man to fulfill his duties. Education has the twin aim of enabling the individual to realize himself and of adjusting him harmoniously and usefully to society.
- In his masterpiece, The Republic, Plato has recommended a state controlled compulsory and comprehensive scheme of education meant for both men and women.
- As Prof. Sabine has rightly pointed out Plato's plan is, therefore, for a state controlled system of compulsory education.
- His educational scheme falls naturally into two parts, the elementary education, which includes the training of the young person's up to the age of 20 and culminating in the beginning of military services and the higher education intended for those selected persons of both sexes who are to be members of the two ruling classes and extending from the age of 20 to 35.
- Plato considered the stat  as an educational institution capable of providing the benefits of education to each and every student in his ideal state.
- The curriculu  of the elementary education was divided into two parts, gymnastics for training the body and music for training the mind, The elementary education was to be imparted to all the three classes.
- But after the age of twenty  those selected for higher positions in the guardian class between twenty and thirty five. The guardians were to be constituted of the auxiliary class, and the ruling class. These two classes were to have a higher doze of gymnasium and music, greater doze of gymnastics or the auxiliaries, and greater doze of music for the rulers.
- The higher educatio  of the two classes was, in purpose, professional and for his curriculum Plato chose the only scientific studies – mathematics, astronomy and logic. Before the two classes could get on to their jobs, Plato suggested a further education till the age of about fifty, mostly practical in nature.
### Platonic scheme of education was progressive and systematic. Its characteristics can be summarized as follows.
- It was state controlled compulsory
- It aimed at attaining the physical, moral, mental and intellectual development of human personality.
- It is a graded process which consisted of different levels and stages starting from 6 to 50 years.
- His scheme was particularly aimed at producing philosopher kings, the rulers in his ideal state;
- His educational plan aimed at preparing the rulers for administrative statesmanship, soldiers for military skill, and producers for material productivity and finally.
- His educational plans sought to bring a balance between the individual needs and social requirements.
## Criticism to Plato's education scheme
- Plato's scheme of education was undemocratically devised in so far as it ignored the producing class completely.
- It was limited in nature and was restrictive in extent by laying more emphasis on mathematics and logic than on literature.
- The whole plan was unexpectedly and unduly expensive.
- Platonic scheme of education will create an ideal philosopher more than an ideal man of action.
- Plato does not sufficiently realize that education should be relative to the character of the individual
## Communism
- According to Plato, justice could be achieved by spiritual and material means. While education is the remedial measure for the achievement of justice through spiritual means communism is the solution through material means.
- While education was designed to create the proper environment for the nurturing and development of the human soul, the communism tried to eliminate all the negativities that obstructed the proper growth of the individual.
- Platonic theory of communism has two parts -
- Communism of family otherwise known as communism of wives and children, and
- Communism of property.
- Plato's ideal state consisted of three classes, those of the rulers, of the auxiliaries, and of theproducers, each class doing its own assigned duties and responsibilities with utmost sincerity and devotion.
- The to guardians are to live a life very different from that of the producers, one in which they must forgo all that makes life for the ordinary man worth living.
- Plato believed that justice would be ushered in if the ruling class does away with property, for property represents the elements of appetite, and to do away with properly demands the communism of families.
- As Ernest Barker has rightly pointed out the abolition of family life among the guardians is thus, inevitably a corollary of their renunciation of private property.
- According to Prof. Dunning "primary property and family relationships appear to be the chief sources of dissension in every community, neither is to have recognition in the perfect state".
- Plato abolished private family life and property for the ruling class for they encouraged nepotism, favoritism particularism, factionalism and other corrupt practices commonly found among the rulers.
- Politics was to promote common good and interest of the state. Plato thereby established a high standard for the rulers. He proposed that the members of the guardian class live together in: common barrack. The life of the guardian class would be in accordance with the rule followed among the Greeks that friends have all things in common.
- In the Republic Plato devoted greater space and consideration to communism of family than to property. This was mainly because he had perturbed by the negative emotions of hatred, selfishness and the envy that the family encouraged.
- Plato believed that conventional marriage led to women's subordination, subjugation and seclusion. He rejected the idea of marriage as a spiritual union based on love and mutual respect.
- However, marriage was necessary to ensure the reproduction and continuation of the human race. He, therefore, advocated temporary sexual union for the purpose of bearing the children.He relieved women of child caring responsibilities.
- Once children were born, they would be taken care of by the state controlled nurseries, which would be equipped with well trained nurses. Except for the philosopher ruler, none would know the parentage of these children.
- Plato's argument for communism of property and family was that the unity of the state demands their abolition. Prof. Sabine wrote thus: "The unity of the state is to secure; property and family stand in the way; therefore, property and marriage must go".
## State and Government
- In all his works on political theory, there is a strong case, which Plato builds in favor of an Omni- competent state. Living is one thing but living well is another and perhaps a different thing altogether. According to Plato, it is the duty of the state or govt. to help people live a complete life.
- The problem which Plato addressed was not having best a govt. could be created but how best a govt. could be installed.
- His model state is an Ideal state ruled by an ideal ruler known as Philosopher King. In Republic, Plato constructs his ideal state on the analogy between the individual and the state. According to Plato, human soul consists of three elements of reason, spirit and appetite, functioning within proper bounds.
- Plato's Ideal state comprises of three classes, namely the ruling class, the warriors and the producing class. The main objective of his ideal state is good life and Plato let his imagination pursue this good which results in the portrayal of a utopia.
- Plato's portrayal of an ideal state may be compared to an artist's portrayal of an ideal landscape. His ideal state is an ideal in the sense that it is an exhibition of what a state ought to be. The ideal state was a reflection of man's best and noblest self and provided the medium in which a man found his best self.
- Plato believed that man found hi  perfection only in the ideal state.
- Plato builds his ideal state in three successive stages.
- In the first stage, Plato believes that men and women are different in degree only and not in kind. Hence they should be given same educational facilities and should partake in the same public functions.
- In the second stage Plato advocates the abolition of the family on the basis of communism of property and wives among the two upper classes.
- In the third stage he introduced the rule of philosophy.
- Plato's ideal state is hierarchical in composition and functions. At the head of the ideal state is a philosopher ruler highly qualified people capable of ruling the country either fear or favour.
- In order to ensure a steady supply of philosopher rulers, Plato advocated a state controlled compulsory scheme of education meant for the children belonging to all the three classes of people. The communism of family and property among the two upper classes was meant to keep them out of economic and world temptations and ambitions so that they could concentrate on their duty to the state.
- The other features of the ideal state were functional specialization, equality of men and women and censorship of art. Having outlined the details of an ideal state, Plato examined other types of regimes, accounting for their decline and decay.
- Plato discusses five types of regimes
    - They are Aristocracy, Timocracy, Oligarchy, Democracy, and Tyranny.
